# supernet
Supernet and Subnets calculator, for FWs and beyond!! 

A very very very crud implementation of a calculator of a supernet and its subnets, provding the global address range taking only supnet and subnet CIDR suffixes, and the real range, taking "range start" and "number of address" into account.

I encourage getting inspired and even maybe using the code that populates the subnets array, rather than the code that concatenate old-school HTML code...
(would love the contribution of better one!) 

Of course feedback is welcome! 

CIDR calculation inspired by: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59156309/how-to-get-from-to-ip-address-from-cidr-bigquery

## Usage:
Just open my `subnet_calc.html` file in a browser. I worked on Chrome..

Hey I just learned a new trick! Click here, and it'll open the HTML directly from the Github repo: https://raw.githack.com/doronlevari/supernet/main/subnet_calc.html



Enjoy,
