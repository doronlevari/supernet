# supernet
Supernet and Subnets calculator, for containerized FWs and beyond!! 

A very very very crud implementation of a calculator of a supernet and its subnets, provding the global address range taking only supnet and subnet CIDR suffixes, and the real range, taking "range start" and "number of address" into account.

I encourage getting inspired and even maybe using the code that populates the subnets array, rather than the code that concatenate old-school HTML code...
(would love the contribution of better one!) 

Of course feedback is welcome! 

CIDR calculation inspired by: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59156309/how-to-get-from-to-ip-address-from-cidr-bigquery
